A coupon plugin that will allow you to set single or multiple rules with "AND" or "OR(Full Version)" conditional operator.

== Description ==
Reach your goals by making your campaign more flexible and less hassle behind.

Catch your customer’s attention by giving them discounts and being able to upsell some products at the same time. Or, get their attention by giving discounts through various conditions to engage them more on your products.

With our Coupon Discount Rules, you can set single or multiple conditions easily with AND or OR(Full Version) conditions. You don’t have to worry about writing codes to make those conditions possible by simply assigning them with other conditions you can build the set of rules on the fly.

== When the plugin is best to use? ==
This plugin is best suited for sale campaigns such as Black Fridays and Christmas. It will help you to reach your target revenue by engaging them via discounts.

== How does it work? ==
On every coupon you’ve created you can set a rule or multiple rules with AND or OR(Full Version) conditions. If those conditions are being met by the user the coupon will automatically apply to their cart.
